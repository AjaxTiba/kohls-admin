:::note
Kohl's Admin is currently in development. Everything in these docs is subject to change.

This section explains the steps on how to revert back to the legacy loader from the new loader which is more stable.

This shows the difference between KA New Loader vs the Legacy Loader.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pros" label="KA New Loader" default>
    KA New Loader is currently still in Beta which continues to improve over time reducing and increasing the number of bugs and features respectively.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cons" label="KA Legacy Loader">
    KA Legacy Loader is no longer receiving updates towards the system, but will continue to receive security and large bugs fixes. 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have KA installed in your game before continuing.

- **KA Installation Guide**: Click [here](/docs/getting-started/installation) to go to the setup guide.

Also ensure that you have both the **Explorer** and **Properties** tabs open.

- You can do this by going to **View** on the menu of Roblox Studio, and toggle `Explorer` and `Properties` which is on the top left.

:::warning
There will be 2 `Settings` scripts, one inside the `Legacy_Loader` script and the other in the model, it is **DIFFERENT** and will not save with one another.
