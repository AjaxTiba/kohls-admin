# Configuration

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

:::note
Kohl's Admin is currently in development. Everything in these docs is subject to change.
:::

This shows you how to configure Kohl's Admin to your liking, and how to continue setting it up.

This will show you the location between the 2 settings scripts for both the New and Legacy Loaders.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="pros" label="KA New Loader" default>
    Kohl's Admin > Settings
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cons" label="KA Legacy Loader">
    Kohl's Admin > Legacy_Loader > Settings
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have KA installed in your game before continuing.

- **KA Installation Guide**: Click [here](/docs/getting-started/installation) to go to the setup guide.

Also ensure that you have both the **Explorer** and **Properties** tabs open.

- You can do this by going to **View** on the menu of Roblox Studio, and toggle `Explorer` and `Properties` which is on the top left.

:::warning
There will be 2 `Settings` scripts, one inside the `Legacy_Loader` script and the other in the model, it is **DIFFERENT** and will not save with one another.
:::

## Hierarchy of Admin Powers

Legacy Loader:
```lua
		Admin Powers

	0			Player
	1			VIP					Can use nonabusive commands only on self
	2			Moderator			Can kick, mute, & use most commands
	3			Administrator		Can ban, crash, & set Moderators/VIP
	4			SuperAdmin			Can grant permanent powers, & shutdown the game
	5			Owner				Can set SuperAdmins, & use all the commands
	6			Game Creator		Can set owners & use all the commands
```
New Loader:

The new loader does not stack admin perks, they are now separated by default.
```lua 
		0	defaultRole
		1	vip
		2	mod
		3	admin
		4	superadmin
		5	creator
```

## Types of Identifiers

## Configuring the Legacy Loader

### Banning Someone from Joining

Unedited Script:
```lua
local Banned = { "someoneyoudislike" } -- For those who have wronged you, & this guy
```
You can add more people or a single player by adding their Username or UserID. The list is endless.
```lua
local Banned = { "someoneyoudislike", "Roblox", 1234567 } -- For those who have wronged you, & this guy
```

### Adding Someone to your Admin List

Unedited Script:
```lua
local Owners = {} -- Can set SuperAdmins, & use all the commands
local SuperAdmins = {} -- Can set permanent admins, & shutdown the game
local Admins = {} -- Can ban, crash, & set Moderators/VIP
local Mods = {} -- Can kick, mute, & use most commands
local VIP = {} -- Can use nonabusive commands only on self
```
You can add more people or a single player by adding their Username or UserID. The list is endless.
```lua
local Owners = {"someoneyoudislike", "Roblox", 1234567} -- Can set SuperAdmins, & use all the commands
...
```

### Settings

This part should be pretty self explantory. The things they do are noted next to them.
```lua
local Settings = {

	-- Style Options
	Flat = true, -- Enables Flat theme / Disables Aero theme
	ForcedColor = false, -- Forces everyone to have set color & transparency
	Color = Color3.new(0, 0, 0), -- Changes the Color of the user interface
	ColorTransparency = 0.75, -- Changes the Transparency of the user interface
	Chat = false, -- Enables the custom chat
	BubbleChat = false, -- Enables the custom bubble chat

	-- Basic Settings
	AdminCredit = true, -- Enables the credit GUI for that appears in the bottom right
	AutoClean = false, -- Enables automatic cleaning of hats & tools in the Workspace
	AutoCleanDelay = 60, -- The delay between each AutoClean routine
	CommandBar = true, -- Enables the Command Bar | GLOBAL KEYBIND: \
	FunCommands = true, -- Enables fun yet unnecessary commands
	FreeAdmin = false, -- Set to 1-5 to grant admin powers to all, otherwise set to false
	JoinMessage = true, -- Shows an admin message on join with the prefix and your current rank
	PublicLogs = false, -- Allows all users to see the command & chat logs
	Prefix = ";", -- Character to begin a command
}
```

### Adding a Group to your Admin List

This part should also be pretty self explantory as well, the required information is stated below the spot where you are supposed to fill them.
```lua
	GroupAdmin = {
		[12345] = { [254] = 4, [253] = 3 };
		[GROUP_ID] = { [RANK] = ADMIN_POWER };
    }
```

To add on more groups or ranks, just add on this line under.
```lua
[12345] = { [254] = 4, [253] = 3 };
```
### Adding VIP Perks to your Game

This part should also be self explantory, the required information is stated under.
```lua
	VIPAdmin = {
		[-12345] = 3; -- negative item_id (-12345) indicates a GamePass
		[12345] = 3; -- positive is every other catalog asset (shirts, pants, hats, etc)
		[54321] = 4;
		[ITEM_ID] = ADMIN_POWER;
    }
```
To add on more assets for VIP, just add a line under.
```lua
[54321] = 4;
```
### Command Limits

This should be self explantory too, the required information is stated above.
```lua
-- Command Limits
	-- COMMAND_LIMIT    - How many commands can be used at once to prevent abuse.
	-- COOLDOWN_SECONDS - How long to wait between commands to prevent abuse.
	-- [ADMIN_POWER]= { COMMAND_LIMIT, COOLDOWN_SECONDS }
	CommandLimits = {
		[0] = { 1, 10 }, -- Player (rank 0) can use 1 command every 10 seconds
		[1] = { 16, 5 }, -- VIP (rank 1) can use 10 commands every 5 seconds
		[2] = { 32, 1 }, -- Moderator (rank 2) can use 16 commands every 1 second
		[3] = { 64, 1 }, -- Administrator (rank 3) can use 32 commands every 1 second
		[4] = { 128, 1 }, -- SuperAdmin (rank 4) can use 64 commands every 1 second
		[5] = { math.huge, 0 }, -- Owner (rank 5) can use infinite commands every 0 seconds
		[6] = { math.huge, 0 }, -- Game Creator (rank 6) can use infinite commands every 0 seconds
		[7] = { math.huge, 0 }, -- True Game Creator (rank 7) can use infinite commands every 0 seconds
	},
```
### Command Permissions

You can refer to the admin permissions table to set up permissions, commands can be found by using the `:cmds` command in chat, or `cmd` in the commandbar.
```lua
	Permissions = {
		-- fly = 0; -- uncomment this line to allow everyone to fly!
	},
```

## Configuring the New Loader

### Settings

This should be self explantory, as it has the required information. The game hub is a place to advertise that your game is using Kohl's, which can attract players. The VIP features is a way to show appreciation to us and our donors for supporting us, although it is optional, I recommend you to keep it, pretty please. 
```lua
	-- Automatic updates from the latest official version of the MainModule
	-- Disable to use the included MainModule
	autoUpdate = true,

	-- Changes the default command prefix
	prefix = ";",

	--[[
	Enables participation in the Kohl's Admin Games Hub, showcasing
	your game to users looking for games with benefits from Kohl's Admin.
	https://www.roblox.com/games/17873329124/Kohls-Admin-Games-Hub

	⚠️ Requires Allowing HTTP Requests in File > Game Settings > Security
	]]
	gameHubEnabled = true,

	-- Enables Kohl's Admin VIP donation features (required for games hub)
	vip = true,
```
### Banning Someone from Joining

This should be self explantory, but the duration is in seconds.
```lua
    [[
	[UserId] = {Username, Reason, Duration, fromUserId}

	Ban duration
		-1 forever
		0 server session
		>0 UTC time in seconds
	]]
	bans = {
		["2"] = { "John Doe", "He been noob.", nil, 44391621 },
		["3"] = { "Jane Doe", "She was noob.", 1720922623, 44391621 },
		["5"] = { nil, "Deleted account", -1, 44391621 },
	},
```
To add more bans, just add this line under.
```lua
		["5"] = { nil, "Deleted account", -1, 44391621 },
```

### Free Admin

If you plan to give **everyone** admin, just remove the `--` based on the permission level/s you wish to give.
```lua
	-- Gives everyone access to the uncommented roles
	freeAdmin = {
		-- "creator",
		-- "superadmin",
		-- "admin",
		-- "mod",
		-- "vip",
	},
```
### Gamepass Admin

If you plan to give a specific gamepass admin, this would help. Just remove the `--` based on the permission level/s you wish to give.
```lua
	gamePassRoles = {
		-- [gamePassId] = { "mod", "vip" },
	},
``` 
### Group Admin

If you plan to give a specific group admin, this would help. Just remove the `--` based on the permission level/s you wish to give.
```lua
	groupRoles = {
		-- [groupId] = {
		-- { rank = 200, roles = { "admin", "vip" }, exactRank = false },
		-- },
	},
```

### User Admin

This should be self explantory, it accepts UserIDs and private server placeid.
```lua
	[[
    Accepts a list of UserIds, sourced from a Roblox profile
		For example;
			https://www.roblox.com/users/44391621/profile
			Has a UserId of 44391621
		Use "game.PrivateServerOwnerId" for private servers!
	]]
	userRoles = {
		creator = {},
		superadmin = {},
		admin = {},
		mod = {},
		vip = { 1, 156, PRIVATE_SERVER_OWNER },
	},
```

### Visibility of Kohl's Dashboard and Join Notifications

This should be pretty self explantory, if you put `1` for the dashboard, only VIPs and higher can see the dashboard button.
```lua
	--[[
	Toggles visibility of the Kohl's Admin Dashboard Button in the Topbar.
		0	defaultRole
		1	vip
		2	mod
		3	admin
		4	superadmin
		5	creator
	]]
	dashboardButtonRank = 0,

	-- Toggles visibility of the Kohl's Admin Join Notification.
	joinNotificationRank = 1,
```
### Admin Roles

This should be self explantory, you can add more ranks and set up how the admin roles work.
```lua
	roles = {
		default = {
			-- role "_rank" determines hierarchy
			-- 0 is reserved for the default role
			_rank = 0,
			name = "Player",
			color = "#0ff",

			-- when enabled only allows their player to be used with the player argument
			-- WARN: doesn't affect commands that use userids!
			onlyTargetSelf = true,

			permissions = {
				-- this permission bypasses all restrictions (danger!)
				admin = false,
				-- can ban users via banasync, otherwise only per server session if has ban command
				banasync = false,
				-- allows the user to manage saved roles of other users with a lesser role
				saveRoles = false,
				-- can configure the global admin settings
				settings = false,
				-- can view server-side logs
				serverlogs = false,
			},

			-- allowed command groups
			groups = {
				-- "creator",
				-- "administration",
				-- "moderation",
				-- "environment",
				-- "general",
				-- "fun",
				-- "vip",
				"utility",
			},

			-- command overrides
			commands = {
				-- allow the help command
				help = true,
				-- disable the shutdown command if given to role by a command group
				shutdown = false,
			},
		},
		vip = {
			_rank = 1,
			name = "VIP",
			groups = { "vip" },
			permissions = {},
			color = "#0f8",
			onlyTargetSelf = true,
		},
		mod = {
			_rank = 2,
			name = "Moderator",
			groups = { "moderation", "general", "environment", "fun", "vip" },
			permissions = { serverlogs = true },
			color = "#0f0",
		},
		admin = {
			_rank = 3,
			name = "Administrator",
			groups = { "administration", "moderation", "general", "environment", "fun", "vip" },
			permissions = { banasync = true, serverlogs = true },
			color = "#ff0",
		},
		superadmin = {
			_rank = 4,
			name = "SuperAdmin",
			groups = { "superadmin", "administration", "moderation", "general", "environment", "fun", "vip" },
			permissions = { banasync = true, saveRoles = true, settings = true, serverlogs = true },
			color = "#f80",
		},
		creator = {
			_rank = math.huge,
			name = "Game Creator",
			permissions = { admin = true },
			color = "#f00",
		},
    }
```
## Verify Installation

1. Open and play the experience that you've imported the model into.
2. Test some basic commands to make sure the admin commands are functioning as expected.
