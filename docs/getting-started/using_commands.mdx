# Using Commands

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

:::note
Kohl's Admin is currently in development. Everything in these docs is subject to change.
:::

This will guide you through on how to run the admin commands for both the legacy and new loader.

## Information

- You can change the prefix by the in-game settings UI, or in the `Settings` script which is shown in the [configuration guide](/docs/getting-started/configuration).
- You can also run `;cmds` to see the commands that you can use.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you already have KA installed in your game before continuing.

- **KA Installation Guide**: Click [here](/docs/getting-started/installation) to go to the setup guide.

## Using the Commandbar

The commandbar is for **PC Users only**.

1. Press `;` on your keyboard to open the commandbar.
2. Type out the command you wish to use without the prefix, or with the prefix, and the required information.
   - You can type out more commands by running multiple commands with the prefix, example: `;size me 2 ;fly me`
3. Press `enter` on your keyboard to run the command.

## Using the Roblox Chat

1. Press `/` on your keyboard to open the chat.
   - If you wish to hide your command in the chat, type `/e ` before the command.
2. Type out the command you wish to use **with the prefix**, and the required information.
   - You can type out more commands by running multiple commands with the prefix, example: `;size me 2 ;fly me`
3. Press `enter` on your keyboard to run the command.
