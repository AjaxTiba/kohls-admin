# Custom Commands

:::note
Kohl's Admin is currently in development. Everything in these docs is subject to change.
:::

Custom commands are a powerful feature that lets you personalize Kohl's Admin, automate tasks, streamline your workflows, and create unique interactions within your experience.

## Prerequisites

- **Make sure you have Kohl's Admin:** Ensure that Kohl's Admin is [present in your experience](/docs/intro).
- **Addons Folder**: Confirm that Kohl's Admin has a folder named **`Addons`**. This is where you'll place your custom command scripts.

## Addon Setup

<!-- TODO: make an addons page! -->

All custom commands are part of an [Addon](/docs/addons). For this section we will create addons that only create custom commands, but in later parts we will show the extent of what addons can do.

All addons are a [ModuleScript](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ModuleScript) that returns a function. To start, create a module script and inside of it write the following:

```lua
return function(_K)
    -- Addon code goes here!
end
```

Inside of this function is where we will be adding our custom commands.
The name of the addon can be anything, but for this example we encourage "customCommands".

:::danger
Adding **`Client`** or **`Server`** an Addon file's name will make it only run in that context. This will make the other context unaware of the command!
:::

## Creating a Custom Command

To create a custom command, you must register it with the [Registry](/api/Registry), using [registerCommand()](/api/Registry#registerCommand).

Using this, our module becomes:

```lua
return function(_K)
    _K.Registry.registerCommand(_K, commandDefinition)
end
```

`commandDefinition` is a placeholder for the real contents of our command! Commands require a lot of information, structured in a [commandDefinition](/api/Registry#CommandDefinition).

```lua
type commandDefinition {
name: string, -- Name of the command.
aliases: { string }?, -- Table of aliases.
description: string, -- Description of what the command does.
group: string, -- What group the command belongs to.
args: { ArgumentDefinition }, -- A table of argument definitions.
envClient: {} | () -> {}?, -- Sets up an environment for the command.
env: {} | () -> {}?, -- Sets up an environment for the command.
runClient: (...any) -> ()?, -- What runs on the client of the player that ran the command.
run: (...any) -> ()? -- What the command runs on the server.
}
```

To give an example, this is the code from the `ExampleAddon`:

```lua
-- addons not containing in "Client" or "Server" will run in both contexts (shared)
return function(_K)
	_K.log(`Hello World from ExampleAddon!`, "INFO")

	_K.Registry.registerCommand(_K, {
		name = "customcommand",
		aliases = { "customcommandalias", "customcommandalias2" },
		description = "Custom command description.",

		-- The command group to sort the command by, this is what roles use to easily assign groups of commands.
		-- Default groups in order of abusability are "Utility", "Environment", "General", "Fun", "Moderation", "Administration", and "Creator"
		group = "General", -- Command group to use.

		-- Argument definitions
		args = {
			{
				type = "stringGreedy",
				name = "Message",
				description = "The message to send.", -- Description shown in command listings.
				-- If the command is optional, make sure to check if it's nil and not false!
				optional = true,

				lowerRank = false,
				ignoreSelf = false,
				shouldRequest = false,
			},
		},

		-- Command environment

		env = function(_K)
			-- This will only run once on each server
			_K.log(`Hello World from ExampleAddon customcommand env!`, "INFO")

			-- This table is passed to the `run` function as `context.env`
			return {
				countServer = 0,
			}
		end,

		envClient = function(_K)
			-- This will only run once on each client
			_K.log(`Hello World from ExampleAddon customcommand envClient!`, "INFO")

			-- This table is passed to the `runClient` function as `context.env`
			return {
				countClient = 0,
			}
		end,

		-- Command execution

		-- Function that runs on the server
		run = function(context, message: string?)
			print("Custom command ran on server!", context, message)

			-- Create a simple Roblox message object
			local messageInstance = Instance.new("Message", workspace)

			-- Since our message is optional we need to check for context.OPTIONAL
			messageInstance.Text = if message == context.OPTIONAL then "Default message" else message

			-- This will destroy the message after 5 seconds
			task.delay(5, messageInstance.Destroy, messageInstance)

			-- Number of times the command has been used on this server
			context.env.countServer += 1
		end,

		-- Function that runs on the player's client
		runClient = function(context, message)
			print("Custom command ran on the client!", context, message)

			-- Number of times the command has been used on this client
			context.env.countClient += 1
		end,
	})
end
```

This command creates a `Message` instance and populates it with the player provided message. As you can see, the command is registered with a dictionary that lists all information about the command.

:::tip
You can put multiple custom commands in one addon! All you need to do is register multiple commands in the same module.
:::

In later sections, we'll cover more advanced uses of custom commands, including environments and other advanced functionality.
