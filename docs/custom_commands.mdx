# Custom Commands

:::note
Kohl's Admin is currently in development. Everything in these docs is subject to change.
:::

Custom commands are a powerful feature that lets you personalize Kohl's Admin, automate tasks, streamline your workflows, and create unique interactions within your experience.

## Prerequisites

- **Make sure you have Kohl's Admin:** Ensure that Kohl's Admin is [present in your experience](/docs/intro).
- **Addons Folder**: Confirm that Kohl's Admin has a folder named **`Addons`**. This is where you'll place your custom command scripts.

## Addon Setup

<!-- TODO: make an addons page! -->

All custom commands are part of an [Addon](/docs/addons). For this section we will create addons that only create custom commands, but in later parts we will show the extent of what addons can do.

All addons are a [ModuleScript](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/ModuleScript) that returns a function. To start, create a module script and inside of it write the following:

```lua
return function(_K)
    -- Addon code goes here!
end
```

Inside of this function is where we will be adding our custom commands.
The name of the addon can be anything, but for this example we encourage "customCommands".

:::danger
Adding **`Client`** or **`Server`** an Addon file's name will make it only run in that context. This will make the other context unaware of the command!
:::

## Creating a Custom Command

To create a custom command, you must register it with the [Registry](/api/Registry), using [registerCommand()](/api/Registry#registerCommand).

Using this, our module becomes:

```lua
return function(_K)
	_K.Registry.registerCommand(_K, commandDefinition)
end
```

`commandDefinition` is a placeholder for the real contents of our command! Commands require a lot of information, structured in a [commandDefinition](/api/Registry#CommandDefinition).

```lua
type commandDefinition {
	name: string,                       -- Name of the command.
	aliases: { string }?,               -- Table of aliases.
	description: string,                -- Description of what the command does.
	group: string,                      -- What group the command belongs to.
	noLog: boolean?,                    -- If the command should be hidden from logs.
	args: { ArgumentDefinition }?,      -- A table of argument definitions.
	permissions: { [string]: boolean }? -- A table of role permissions required to run the command.
	envClient: {} | () -> {}?,          -- Sets up an environment for the command.
	env: {} | () -> {}?,                -- Sets up an environment for the command.
	runClient: (...any) -> ()?,         -- What runs on the client of the player that ran the command.
	run: (...any) -> ()?                -- What the command runs on the server.
}
```

Look at the [Example Addon](https://github.com/kohls-admin/kohls-admin/blob/master/model/Config/addons/src/ExampleAddon.luau) to learn how to customize a [commandDefinition](/api/Registry#CommandDefinition).

:::tip
You can put multiple custom commands in one addon! All you need to do is register multiple commands in the same module.
