     cd kohls-admin
     ```

     git config pull.rebase true;
     ```
   - **Install Project Dependencies:**

     rokit install;
     rojo plugin install;
     ```

4. Test Your Changes in Roblox Studio

   - **Start the Rojo Server:**
     ```bash
     rojo serve test.project.json
     ```
   - **Connect Studio to Rojo:** Open Roblox and use the [Rojo plugin](https://rojo.space/docs/v7/getting-started/installation/#installing-the-plugin) to connect to the server you just started.


#### GitHub Codespaces

1. Open this project in GitHub Codespaces

   - Click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" badge or the Code button, then click the Codespaces tab, and "Create codespace on main."
   ![Create codespace on main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/229f37b8-9650-4809-b79a-37a565f6c855)

3. Setup the Rojo plugin

   - [Install the Rojo plugin](https://rojo.space/docs/v7/getting-started/installation/#installing-the-plugin) on Roblox Studio from [GitHub](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases) or [Roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com/library/13916111004/Rojo).


4. Test Your Changes in Roblox Studio

   - **Start the Rojo Server:**
     ```bash
     rojo serve test.project.json
     ```
   - **Change the port visibility to Public:** Open the terminal in your codespace. Click the **PORTS** tab. Right-click the port **Rojo (34872)**, click the **Port Visibility**, then click **Public**.
      ![Screenshot of the pop-up menu for a forwarded port, with the "Port Visibility" option selected and "Private" selected in the submenu.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-59966/mw-1440/images/help/codespaces/make-public-option.webp)
   - **Copy the forwarded port address:** To the right of the local address for the port, click the copy icon.
      ![Screenshot of the "Ports" panel. The copy icon, which copies a forwarded port's URL, is highlighted with an orange outline.](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-19922/mw-1440/images/help/codespaces/copy-icon-port-url.webp)
   - **Connect Studio to Rojo:** Open Roblox and in the [Rojo plugin](https://rojo.space/docs/v7/getting-started/installation/#installing-the-plugin), paste the port address you copied. Remove the `https://` at the beginning and the `/` of the forwarded address. It should look something like this: `probable-memory-w44vgv9v4vpfjwj-34872.app.github.dev`, and set the port as `80`. Finally, connect to the server you just started.
